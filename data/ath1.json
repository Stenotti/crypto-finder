      "en": "Tether (USDT) is a cryptocurrency with a value meant to mirror the value of the U.S. dollar. The idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that can be used like digital dollars. Coins that serve this purpose of being a stable dollar substitute are called “stable coins.” Tether is the most popular stable coin and even acts as a dollar replacement on many popular exchanges! According to their site, Tether converts cash into digital currency, to anchor or “tether” the value of the coin to the price of national currencies like the US dollar, the Euro, and the Yen. Like other cryptos it uses blockchain. Unlike other cryptos, it is [according to the official Tether site] “100% backed by USD” (USD is held in reserve). The primary use of Tether is that it offers some stability to the otherwise volatile crypto space and offers liquidity to exchanges who can’t deal in dollars and with banks (for example to the sometimes controversial but leading exchange <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bitfinex\">Bitfinex</a>).\r\n\r\nThe digital coins are issued by a company called Tether Limited that is governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, according to the legal part of its website. It is incorporated in Hong Kong. It has emerged that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has been accused of being involved in the price manipulation of bitcoin, as well as tether. Many people trading on exchanges, including Bitfinex, will use tether to buy other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Tether Limited argues that using this method to buy virtual currencies allows users to move fiat in and out of an exchange more quickly and cheaply. Also, exchanges typically have rocky relationships with banks, and using Tether is a way to circumvent that.\r\n\r\nUSDT is fairly simple to use. Once on exchanges like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/poloniex\">Poloniex</a> or Bittrex, it can be used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It can be easily transferred from an exchange to any Omni Layer enabled wallet. Tether has no transaction fees, although external wallets and exchanges may charge one. In order to convert USDT to USD and vise versa through the Tether.to Platform, users must pay a small fee. Buying and selling Tether for Bitcoin can be done through a variety of exchanges like the ones mentioned previously or through the Tether.to platform, which also allows the conversion between USD to and from your bank account.",

Like other cryptocurrencies, Ripple is built atop the idea of a distributed ledger network which requires various parties to participate in validating transactions, rather than any singular centralized authority. That facilitates transactions all over the world, and transfer fees are far cheaper than the likes of bitcoin. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP transfers are effectively immediate, requiring no typical confirmation time.\r\n\r\nRipple was originally founded by a single company, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ripple-labs\">Ripple Labs</a>, and continues to be backed by it, rather than the larger network of developers that continue <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">bitcoin’s</a> development. It also doesn’t have a fluctuating amount of its currency in existence. Where bitcoin has a continually growing pool with an eventual maximum, and Ethereum theoretically has no limit, Ripple was created with all of its 100 billion XRP tokens right out of the gate. That number is maintained with no mining and most of the tokens are owned and held by Ripple Labs itself — around 60 billion at the latest count.\r\n\r\nEven at the recently reduced value of around half a dollar per XRP, that means Ripple Labs is currently sitting on around $20 billion worth of the cryptocurrency (note: Ripple’s price crashed hard recently, and may be worth far less than $60 billion by time you read this). It holds 55 billion XRP in an escrow account, which allows it to sell up to a billion per month if it so chooses in order to fund new projects and acquisitions. Selling such an amount would likely have a drastic effect on the cryptocurrency’s value, and isn’t something Ripple Labs plans to do anytime soon.\r\n\r\nIn actuality, Ripple Labs is looking to leverage the technology behind XRP to allow for faster banking transactions around the world. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built on the idea of separating financial transactions from the financial organizations of traditional currencies, Ripple is almost the opposite in every sense.\r\n\r\nXRP by Ripple price can be found on this page alongside the market capitalization and additional stats.\r\n\r\n",

      "ja": "Rippleは、Cryptocurrencyプラットフォームのキャッチオール名であり、トランザクションプロトコルは実際にはXRPで、EthereumはEtherでの取引を容易にするプラットフォームの名前です。他の暗号化通貨と同様に、Rippleは、分散元帳ネットワークの考え方の上に構築されており、様々な当事者が単一の集中管理機関ではなくトランザクションの検証に参加する必要があります。これは世界中の取引を容易にし、振込手数料はビットコインのようなものよりはるかに安いです。他の暗号化通貨とは異なり、XRP転送は実質的に即時であり、典型的な確認時間を必要としません。\r\n\r\nRippleはもともとは単一の会社Ripple Labsによって設立されたもので、Bitcoinの開発を継続する大規模な開発者ネットワークではなく、引き続きサポートされています。また、現存する通貨の変動額もありません。ビットコインが絶え間なく成長するプールを持ち、エテリアムには理論的に限界がないため、Rippleはゲートから100億XRPのトークンをすべて使用して作成されました。その数字は採掘なしで維持されており、トークンの大部分はRipple Labs自身が所有し保持しています。\r\n\r\n最近XRPあたり約50ドルの値下げがあったとしても、Ripple Labsは現在、約200億ドル相当の暗号侵害を抱えています（注：Rippleの価格は最近急落しており、これを読む）。エスクロー口座に550億のXRPを保有しているため、新規プロジェクトや買収に資金を提供するために選択すれば、月額10億ドルまで売却することができます。そのような量を売ることは、暗号侵害の価値に大きな影響を及ぼす可能性が高く、Ripple Labsがすぐに計画しているものではありません。\r\n\r\n実際、Ripple LabsはXRPの背後にあるテクノロジーを活用して、世界中の銀行取引をより迅速に行うことを検討しています。ビットコインや他の暗号化通貨は、金融取引を伝統的な通貨の金融機関から切り離すという考えに基づいて作られていますが、リップルはあらゆる意味でほぼ反対です。",

      "ko": "리플코인은 금융 거래를 위한 인터넷 프로토콜인 ‘리플 프로토콜’에서 사용되는 디지털 자산이자 기초 화폐입니다. 이 코인을 매개로 전 세계의 화폐를 몇 초 내로 송금할 수 있어 혁신적인 실시간 통화 거래가 가능합니다. '리플 프로토콜'이란 분산원장을 기반으로 한 ‘실시간 총액결제 시스템(RTS)’으로 국제결제시스템망(SWIFT)을 대체할 새로운 대안으로 주목받고 있습니다.\r\n\r\n송금 시스템에 가까운 특성이 있어 일반적인 가상화폐와는 그 구조가 다릅니다. 사용하는 합의 프로토콜도 독자적일 뿐만 아니라, 다른 코인들과 다르게 현실적으로 주도권의 집중화가 있기 때문입니다. 따라서 리플의 시스템은 한정된 참여자만 분산 네트워크를 구성한다는 의미에서 프라이빗 블록체인(private blockchain)이라고 불리기도 합니다. \r\n\r\n리플사는 총량의 62%의 코인을 보유하고 있으며, 사업 개발 단계에 따라 전략적으로 시장에 유통하고 있습니다. 리플사는 그들이 전체 유통의 반수 이상으로 보유하고 있는 코인을 악용할 우려를 잠재우기 위해 암호화를 통해 보호된 조건부 날인 계정(escrow)에 리플을 넣어둔다고 합니다.\r\n\r\n코인 특징\r\n1. 현재 주로 은행 간 이체서비스에 집중하여 진행 중이며, 리플 네트워크에는 미쓰비시 도쿄UFJ 은행, 스웨덴 SEB, 중동의 아부다비 국립은행과 인도 Axis 은행을 비롯한 세계 주요 금융권 75개가 참여하고 있습니다. 매년 빠른 속도로 확장하고 있으며, 최근 이들의 적극적인 참여로 상호 송금 거래 규모는 하루 7700만 달러를 넘어섰습니다.\r\n\r\n2. 리플은 연결 통화(bridge currency)로 역할 하므로 기존 통화시장과 달리 수요가 적은 희귀통화를 거래하기 쉽습니다. 복잡한 거래 과정이 불필요하고, 추가적인 비용도 지출되지 않기 때문입니다. \r\n\r\n3. 거래마다 0.0004달러의 수수료를 지급합니다. 이는 네트워크 스팸 공격을 막기 위한 것이며, 매우 적은 액수이므로 기존의 결제시스템보다 비교우위에 있습니다. 또한, 이 수수료는 영원히 소멸하게 되는데, 이는 시간이 지날수록 토큰의 가치가 조금씩 높아짐을 의미합니다. \r\n\r\n4. 인플레이션이 없습니다. 시간이 지날수록 화폐 총량이 늘어나는 대부분 가상화폐와 달리, 리플은 초기에 총 1천억 개 발행되었고 이제 더 추가로 생성되지 않기 때문입니다.\r\n\r\n핵심 가치\r\n(키워드: 환전/송금 거래에 P2P 네트워크의 적용)\r\n\r\nP2P 네트워크는 서로 모르는 사람 혹은 은행 간의 외환 거래를 중개하는 다리를 만들어 줍니다. 따라서 SWIFT와 같은 중개기관이 필요하지 않아 저렴한 비용으로 신속한 국제 결제 서비스를 가능하게 합니다.\r\n\r\n1. 결제 비용 감소: 중개기관을 거치지 않으므로 수수료를 절약 가능합니다. 특히 환전 시 달러 거래와 달리 은행 계좌를 요구하지 않기 때문에 서비스 수수료나 추가 운용 비용이 발생하지 않습니다. 따라서 리플은 기존 환율보다 훨씬 더 경쟁력 있는 외환 가격을 제공합니다. \r\n\r\n2. 실시간 결제: 전 세계 어디든 거래당 4초가 걸리며 즉각적인 정산이 가능합니다. XRP는 연중무휴로 초당 50,000건의 거래를 처리합니다.",

      "en": "Cardano is a decentralised platform that will allow complex programmable transfers of value in a secure and scalable fashion. It is one of the first blockchains to be built in the highly secure Haskell programming language. Cardano is developing a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=29\">smart contract platform</a> which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed. It is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.\r\n\r\nThe Cardano project is different from other blockchain projects as it openly addresses the need for regulatory oversight whilst maintaining consumer privacy and protections through an innovative software architecture. The protocol features a layered blockchain software stack that is flexible, scalable, and is being developed with the most rigorous academic and commercial software standards in the industry. \r\n\r\nCardano will use a democratic governance system that allows the project to evolve over time, and fund itself sustainably through a visionary treasury system.\r\n\r\nTechnological Innovation\r\nCardano is the first protocol to incorporate Ouroboros, the ground breaking <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Proof+of+Stake&view=market\">proof of stake algorithm</a>. The IOHK team employed a “first-principles” approach, driven by peer-reviewed academic research to build Cardano from the ground up.\r\n\r\nThe result of this collaborative effort is the first cryptocurrency to be based in Haskell code, which focuses on industrial strength product that delivers the resilience necessary for mission-critical systems, in this case, securing investment.\r\n\r\nCardano’s multi-layer protocol performs advanced functions, and has a settlement layer that is elegantly linked to a control layer. The settlement layer will have a unit of account, while the control layer will run smart contracts and will be programmed to recognize identity, assisting compliance (and allowing blacklisting, for instance).\r\n\r\nThe protocol is geared towards protecting privacy rights of users, while also taking into account the needs of regulators. In doing so, Cardano is the first protocol to balance these requirements in a nuanced and effective way, pioneering a new approach for cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\nThe system is also designed to allow upgrade through soft forks, enabling it to adapt to changing needs and evolve quickly, when required. A treasury system is also being installed that will ensure the sustainability of the protocol.\r\n\r\nCardano is built in the spirit of collaboration by being completely open source and patent-free. Engineered for efficiency and scalability, the Cardano ecosystem will develop into the most complete cryptocurrency ever constructed.\r\n\r\nConceptual Innovation\r\n\r\ni. Privacy and regulation\r\nThe original <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> blockchain was meant to be a way for individuals to transact directly and anonymously with each other outside the control of banks and governments. This guarantees privacy in financial dealings, a fundamental individual right, but full anonymity can be counterproductive. Today most blockchain projects look to further either the aims of privacy or of regulation. To be effective globally, we think our blockchain must ‘square the circle’ by finding the right mix of individual privacy protection and provision for regulatory control.\r\n\r\nii. Governance\r\nPublic, decentralized blockchain projects rely on crowd-based governance models. This allows for democratic control of the network by its participants, which is essential to building truly decentralised economies. However, if they are not carefully designed, such governance can go awry. Both the Bitcoin and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> communities have experienced devastating schisms on the question of how to upgrade their networks – in Ethereum's case already causing a split. The Cardano blockchain has an airtight governance model that allow the community to democratically take clear and binding decisions.\r\n\r\niii. Funding\r\nThe Cardano blockchain has sophisticated maintenance and development needs and is able to adequately fund itself, both in terms of running costs and new investment.\r\n\r\nThe Token: ADA Voucher\r\nEvery blockchain project has a token of value commonly referred to as a cryptocurrency. Ada is the cryptocurrency on the Cardano blockchain. With Ada, holders can send value between friends, pay for a good or service, deposit funds on an exchange, or enter an application. To perform a transfer on the settlement layer requires you own Ada, or acquire Ada through an exchange. It will also be the native token to be used in applications built on the computation layer.\r\n\r\nThe Wallet: <a href=\"https://daedaluswallet.io/\">Daedalus</a>\r\nEach cryptocurrency requires a “wallet” to store Ada. Typically this wallet is a software application that can be installed on any computer or smartphone. Daedalus is a highly-engineered wallet with advanced security features that was developed by <a href=\"https://iohk.io/\">IOHK</a> specifically for the Cardano blockchain and protects your assets with the most advanced cryptography. In the future, Daedalus will not only support Ada, but other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum-classic\">Ethereum Classic</a> and many more.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"https://cardanofoundation.org/en/\">Cardano Foundation</a>\r\nThe Cardano Foundation’s core mission is to standardise, protect and promote the Cardano Protocol technology. The Cardano Foundation acts as a supervisory and educational body for Cardano. Our mission is to:\r\n\r\n1. Standardise, protect and promote the Cardano Protocol and its applications\r\n2. Be a community hub offering authoritative, timely information about the technology and Cardano’s wide-ranging potential\r\n3. Liaise and influence government and regulatory bodies, form strategic partnerships with businesses, enterprises and other open source projects and aid the creation of formal software standards for Cardano, a crucial feature for its long term success and critical in adoption and government engagement\r\n\r\nAreas of Focus:\r\n1. Cardano Protocol - We function as an objective standards body for the Cardano protocol as it evolves over time.\r\n2. Cardano community - We support, grow and help educate the Cardano blockchain community.\r\n3. Cardano ecosystem - We work to expand and protect the Cardano ecosystem. This includes promoting Cardano as a platform for commercial entities and serving as an objective organization for enterprises interested in joining Cardano.\r\n4. Serving the wider blockchain community - We aim to influence and progress the emerging commercial and legislative landscape for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in general. We proactively approach government and regulatory bodies and form strategic partnerships with businesses, enterprises and other open-source projects.\r\n\r\nIOHK\r\nFounded in 2015 by <a href=\"https://iohk.io/team/charles-hoskinson/\">Charles Hoskinson</a> and <a href=\"https://iohk.io/team/jeremy-wood/\">Jeremy Wood</a>, IOHK is a world-class engineering and technology company committed to using peer-to-peer innovations to provide financial services to three billion people that don’t have them. The group is contracted to design, build, and maintain Cardano through to 2020.\r\n\r\nEmurgo\r\n<a href=\"https://emurgo.io/\">Emurgo</a> is the venture building entity in the Cardano ecosystem, its goal is to aid, integrate, and foster Cardano blockchain applications.\r\n\r\nEmurgo captures the transformative power that blockchain technology brings to the developing world. Decentralized applications built on Cardano technology, funded and supported by Emurgo, will have the potential to build groundbreaking applications.\r\n\r\nProject Road Map\r\nIOHK has now released the settlement layer. This means you can transact, trade, and purchase Ada tokens fully independently of the computation layer. The goal for the computation layer is to have a beta released by the first quarter of 2018. Once both settlement and computation layers are live, users will be able to setup a custom environment to build decentralised applications on the Cardano stack.\r\nIn 2019, IOHK intends to work on Cardano’s long-term scalability and augment its capabilities. As developers, IOHK has been contracted through 2020 to make sure Cardano is being adequately maintained. The goal is to create a sustainable ecosystem that is capable of funding and supporting itself.",

Cardano는 대규모 응용 프로그램을위한 준비가 완료된 성숙한 블록 체인을 목표로합니다.\r\n\r\n기술 혁신\r\n- 카르 다노 (Cardano)는 스테로이드 알고리즘에 대한 획기적인 증거인 Ouroboros를 통합 한 최초의 프로토콜입니다. IOHK 팀은 처음부터 Cardano를 구축하기위한 동료 검토 학술 연구에 힘 입어 \"1 차 원칙\"접근 방식을 채택했습니다.\r\n-이 독창적 인 공동 작업은 분산 시스템, 메커니즘 설계 및 암호화와 같은 분야를 하나로 모으는 제품인 cryptocurrency를 지속적으로 꾸준히 구축했습니다. 그 결과, 하스켈 코드에 기반한 최초의 암호 해독 성이 있습니다.이 코드는 업무 핵심 시스템에 필요한 복원력을 제공하는 산업 강도 제품으로이 경우 투자를 보호합니다.\r\n- Cardano의 다중 레이어 프로토콜은 고급 기능을 수행하고 제어 레이어에 우아하게 연결된 결제 레이어를 기반으로합니다. 결제 계층에는 계정 단위가 있고 제어 계층에는 스마트 계약이 실행되며 신원을 확인하고 규정 준수를 지원하도록 프로그램되어 (예 : 블랙리스트 허용)\r\n-이 프로토콜은 규제 기관의 요구를 고려하면서 사용자의 개인 정보 보호 권리를 보호하기위한 것입니다. 이렇게함으로써 Cardano는 이러한 요구 사항을 미묘하고 효과적인 방식으로 균형을 유지하는 최초의 프로토콜로서 cryptocurrencies에 대한 새로운 접근 방법을 개척했습니다.\r\n- 시스템은 소프트 포크를 통해 업그레이드 할 수 있도록 설계되어 필요에 따라 변화하는 요구 사항에 적응하고 신속하게 진화 할 수 있습니다. 의정서의 지속 가능성을 보장하는 재무 시스템도 설치되고 있습니다.\r\n- 완전 공개 소스 및 특허가없는 Cardano는 협업의 정신으로 만들어졌습니다. 효율성과 확장 성을 위해 설계된 Cardano 에코 시스템은 지금까지 구축 된 가장 완벽한 cryptocurrency로 발전 할 것입니다.\r\n\r\n개념적 혁신\r\n\r\n나는. 개인 정보 보호 및 규제\r\n원래의 Bitcoin 블록 체인은 개인이 은행과 정부의 통제를 벗어난 상태에서 서로 직접 익명으로 거래 할 수있는 방법이었습니다. 이는 금융 거래에서 프라이버시를 보장하며 근본적인 개인 권리입니다. 그러나 완전한 익명 성은 규제 적 감독이 부족한만큼 비생산적 일 수 있습니다. 오늘날 대부분의 블록 체인 프로젝트는 개인 정보 보호 또는 규제의 목표를 향해 나아갑니다. 전 세계적으로 효과를 발휘하기 위해 개인 정보 보호와 규정 통제를 적절히 혼합하여 블록 체인이 '원을 제곱'해야한다고 생각합니다.\r\n\r\nii. 통치\r\n공공적이고 분산 된 블록 체인 프로젝트는 군중 기반 거버넌스 모델에 의존합니다. 이를 통해 참여자들의 네트워크를 민주적으로 통제 할 수 있으며, 이는 진정으로 분산 된 경제를 구축하는 데 필수적입니다. 그러나 신중하게 설계하지 않으면 이러한 통제가 잘못 될 수 있습니다. 둘 다",

      "id": "Cardano is a decentralised platform that will allow complex programmable transfers of value in a secure and scalable fashion. It is one of the first blockchains to be built in the highly secure Haskell programming language. Cardano is developing a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=29\">smart contract platform</a> which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed. It is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.\r\n\r\nThe Cardano project is different from other blockchain projects as it openly addresses the need for regulatory oversight whilst maintaining consumer privacy and protections through an innovative software architecture. The protocol features a layered blockchain software stack that is flexible, scalable, and is being developed with the most rigorous academic and commercial software standards in the industry. \r\n\r\nCardano will use a democratic governance system that allows the project to evolve over time, and fund itself sustainably through a visionary treasury system.\r\n\r\nTechnological Innovation\r\nCardano is the first protocol to incorporate Ouroboros, the ground breaking <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Proof+of+Stake&view=market\">proof of stake algorithm</a>. The IOHK team employed a “first-principles” approach, driven by peer-reviewed academic research to build Cardano from the ground up.\r\n\r\nThe result of this collaborative effort is the first cryptocurrency to be based in Haskell code, which focuses on industrial strength product that delivers the resilience necessary for mission-critical systems, in this case, securing investment.\r\n\r\nCardano’s multi-layer protocol performs advanced functions, and has a settlement layer that is elegantly linked to a control layer. The settlement layer will have a unit of account, while the control layer will run smart contracts and will be programmed to recognize identity, assisting compliance (and allowing blacklisting, for instance).\r\n\r\nThe protocol is geared towards protecting privacy rights of users, while also taking into account the needs of regulators. In doing so, Cardano is the first protocol to balance these requirements in a nuanced and effective way, pioneering a new approach for cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\nThe system is also designed to allow upgrade through soft forks, enabling it to adapt to changing needs and evolve quickly, when required. A treasury system is also being installed that will ensure the sustainability of the protocol.\r\n\r\nCardano is built in the spirit of collaboration by being completely open source and patent-free. Engineered for efficiency and scalability, the Cardano ecosystem will develop into the most complete cryptocurrency ever constructed.\r\n\r\nConceptual Innovation\r\n\r\ni. Privacy and regulation\r\nThe original <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> blockchain was meant to be a way for individuals to transact directly and anonymously with each other outside the control of banks and governments. This guarantees privacy in financial dealings, a fundamental individual right, but full anonymity can be counterproductive. Today most blockchain projects look to further either the aims of privacy or of regulation. To be effective globally, we think our blockchain must ‘square the circle’ by finding the right mix of individual privacy protection and provision for regulatory control.\r\n\r\nii. Governance\r\nPublic, decentralized blockchain projects rely on crowd-based governance models. This allows for democratic control of the network by its participants, which is essential to building truly decentralised economies. However, if they are not carefully designed, such governance can go awry. Both the Bitcoin and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> communities have experienced devastating schisms on the question of how to upgrade their networks – in Ethereum's case already causing a split. The Cardano blockchain has an airtight governance model that allow the community to democratically take clear and binding decisions.\r\n\r\niii. Funding\r\nThe Cardano blockchain has sophisticated maintenance and development needs and is able to adequately fund itself, both in terms of running costs and new investment.\r\n\r\nThe Token: ADA Voucher\r\nEvery blockchain project has a token of value commonly referred to as a cryptocurrency. Ada is the cryptocurrency on the Cardano blockchain. With Ada, holders can send value between friends, pay for a good or service, deposit funds on an exchange, or enter an application. To perform a transfer on the settlement layer requires you own Ada, or acquire Ada through an exchange. It will also be the native token to be used in applications built on the computation layer.\r\n\r\nThe Wallet: <a href=\"https://daedaluswallet.io/\">Daedalus</a>\r\nEach cryptocurrency requires a “wallet” to store Ada. Typically this wallet is a software application that can be installed on any computer or smartphone. Daedalus is a highly-engineered wallet with advanced security features that was developed by <a href=\"https://iohk.io/\">IOHK</a> specifically for the Cardano blockchain and protects your assets with the most advanced cryptography. In the future, Daedalus will not only support Ada, but other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum-classic\">Ethereum Classic</a> and many more.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"https://cardanofoundation.org/en/\">Cardano Foundation</a>\r\nThe Cardano Foundation’s core mission is to standardise, protect and promote the Cardano Protocol technology.

Litecoin uses the memory intensive <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Scrypt\">Scrypt proof of work</a> mining algorithm. Scrypt allows consumer-grade hardware such as GPU to mine those coins.\r\n\r\nWhy Litecoin?\r\nLitecoin is a cryptocurrency that has evolved from Bitcoin after its own popularity in the industry, this alternative, or ‘altcoin’ has emerged to allow investors to diversify their digital currency package, according to Investopedia. Litecoin is one of the most prominent altcoins and was created by former Google employee and Director of Engineering at <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/coinbase_pro\">Coinbase</a>, Charlie Lee. Litecoin was the first to alter Bitcoin and the most significant difference is that it takes 2.5 minutes for Litecoin to generate a block, or transaction, in comparison to Bitcoin's 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n‘While this matters little to traders, miners who use hardware to run Bitcoin's network cannot switch over to Litecoin. This keeps bigger mining conglomerates away from Litecoin because they cannot easily optimize their profits by swapping to another coin, contributing to a more decentralized experience. Litecoin also has bigger blocks, and more coins in circulation, making it more affordable and swift when transacting,’ Investopedia explained.\r\n\r\nAs explained above, Litecoin can transact a lot faster than Bitcoin, but there are also a number of other characteristics that investors need to know before trading. Litecoin can handle higher volumes of transactions because of the capability of transacting faster and if Bitcoin attempted to transact on the scale of its altcoin, a code update would be needed. However, Litecoin’s blocks would be larger, but with more ‘orphaned blocks'. The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks - this is theoretical in the case of both networks having the same hashing power.\r\n\r\nLitecoin Technical Details:\r\nThe transaction confirmation time taken for Litecoin is about 2.5 minutes on average (as compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes). The Litecoin network is scheduled to cap at 84 million currency units. \r\n\r\nLitecoin has inspired many other popular alternative currencies (eg. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin\">Dogecoin</a>) because of its Scrypt hashing algorithm in order to prevent ASIC miners from mining those coins.

Litecoin was the first to alter Bitcoin and the most significant difference is that it takes 2.5 minutes for Litecoin to generate a block, or transaction, in comparison to Bitcoin's 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n‘While this matters little to traders, miners who use hardware to run Bitcoin's network cannot switch over to Litecoin. This keeps bigger mining conglomerates away from Litecoin because they cannot easily optimize their profits by swapping to another coin, contributing to a more decentralized experience. Litecoin also has bigger blocks, and more coins in circulation, making it more affordable and swift when transacting,’ Investopedia explained.\r\n\r\nAs explained above, Litecoin can transact a lot faster than Bitcoin, but there are also a number of other characteristics that investors need to know before trading. Litecoin can handle higher volumes of transactions because of the capability of transacting faster and if Bitcoin attempted to transact on the scale of its altcoin, a code update would be needed. However, Litecoin’s blocks would be larger, but with more ‘orphaned blocks'. The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks - this is theoretical in the case of both networks having the same hashing power.\r\n\r\nLitecoin Technical Details:\r\nThe transaction confirmation time taken for Litecoin is about 2.5 minutes on average (as compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes). The Litecoin network is scheduled to cap at 84 million currency units. \r\n\r\nLitecoin has inspired many other popular alternative currencies (eg. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin\">Dogecoin</a>) because of its Scrypt hashing algorithm in order to prevent ASIC miners from mining those coins. However it is said that by the end of this year, Scrypt ASIC will enter the mass market."

Over the years, these qualities were filtered out of Bitcoin Core and progress was stifled by various people, organizations, and companies involved in Bitcoin protocol development. The result is that Bitcoin Core is currently unusable as money due to increasingly high fees per transactions and transfer times taking hours to complete. This is all because of the 1MB limitation of Bitcoin Core’s block size, causing it unable to accommodate to large number of transactions.\r\n\r\nEssentially Bitcoin Cash is a community-activated upgrade (otherwise known as a hard fork) of Bitcoin that increased the block size to 8MB, solving the scaling issues that plague Bitcoin Core today.\r\n\r\nNov 16th 2018: A hashwar resulted in a split between <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin-cash-sv\">Bitcoin SV</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin-cash-abc\">Bitcoin ABC</a>",

Stellar aims to help facilitate cross-asset transfer of value at a fraction of a penny while aiming to be an open financial system that gives people of all income levels access to low-cost financial services. Stellar can handle exchanges between fiat-based currencies and between cryptocurrencies. Stellar.org, the organization that supports Stellar, is centralized like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ripple\">XRP</a> and meant to handle cross platform transactions and micro transactions like XRP. However, unlike Ripple, Stellar.org is non-profit and their platform itself is open source and decentralized. \r\n\r\nStellar was founded by Jed McCaleb in 2014. Jed McCaleb is also the founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, launched the network system Stellar with former lawyer Joyce Kim. Stellar is also a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and drastically reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers. In fact, both payment networks used the same protocol initially.\r\n\r\nDistributed Exchange\r\nThrough the use of its intermediary currency Lumens (XLM), a user can send any currency that they own to anyone else in a different currency.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if Joe wanted to send USD to Mary using her EUR, an offer is submitted to the distributed exchange selling USD for EUR. This submitted offer forms is known as an order book. The network will use the order book to find the best exchange rate for the transaction in-order to minimize the fee paid by a user.\r\n\r\nThis multi-currency transaction is possible because of \"Anchors\". Anchors are trusted entities that hold people’s deposits and can issue credit. In essence, Anchors serves as the bridge between different currencies and the Stellar network.\r\n\r\nLumens (XLM)\r\nLumens are the native asset (digital currency) that exist on the Stellar network that helps to facilitate multi-currency transactions and prevent spams. For multi-currency transactions, XLM is the digital intermediary that allows for such a transaction to occur at a low cost.\r\n\r\nIn-order to prevent DoS attacks (aka spams) that would inevitably occur on the Stellar network, a small fee of 0.00001 XLM is associated with every transaction that occurs on the network. This fee is small enough so it does not significantly affect the cost of transaction, but large enough so it dissuades bad actors from spamming the network. The collected fee is then redistributed and added to an inflation pool. This inflation pool releases Lumens at a rate of 1% each year.",

      "ko": "스텔라 루멘은 스텔라 결제 네트워크에서 사용되는 가상화폐입니다. 스텔라는 리플 프로토콜에 기초하며, 새로운 버전으로 업그레이드된 시스템입니다. 그러나 애초에 리플에서 포크되었기 때문에 비슷한 점이 많습니다. 스텔라 네트워크의 기본적인 비즈니스모델은 은행, 결제시스템, 그리고 사람들을 연결해주는 플랫폼으로, 공개되는 공공의 장부, 즉 블록체인에 기반을 둔 디지털 금융 서비스를 제공하기 위한 것입니다. 실제로 리플과 비슷하게 다중통화거래(multi-currency transactions)에서 연결통화로서 기능합니다. \r\n\r\n하지만 리플은 영리기업인 리플랩스﻿에서 운영하는 반면, 스텔라는 비영리 단체인 스텔라개발재단﻿에서 담당한다는 차이가 있습니다. 또한, 은행이나 기업과 같은 금융기관을 대상으로 하는 리플과 달리, 스텔라는 개인과 금융소외계층을 주요고객으로 합니다. \r\n\r\n2014년에 출시 됐을 때, 이 화폐의 이름은 스텔라였는데, 2015년 네트워크가 업데이트되면서 루멘으로 이름을 바꿨습니다. 이는 스텔라 네트워크와 stellar.org라는 비영리 단체와 구분하기 위해서입니다.\r\n\r\n코인 특징\r\n1. 총공급량인 1,000억 개의 루멘은 초기에 이미 다 발행되었고 앞으로 배포할 일만 남았다고 합니다. 전체의 5%는 stellar.org에 유보되어 운영비용으로 지출될 것이고, 나머지 95%는 다양한 그룹에 배포될 계획입니다. 50%는 루멘을 원하는 개인들, 25%는 은행시스템을 누리지 못하는 인구, 20%는 비트코인 소유자에게 주어집니다. 실제로 루멘은 비트코인 소유자에게 꾸준히 배포되는 중입니다. 이렇게 루멘을 공짜로 사람들에게 배포하는 이유는 폭넓은 디지털 네트워크를 만들어 저비용의 금융서비스로 사람들을 연결하기 위해서입니다. 스텔라의 개발자들은 이것을 네트워크 확장을 위한 기본적인 초대라고 생각한다고 합니다. \r\n\r\n2. 루멘은 매년 1%의 고정된 인플레이션을 가지고 있습니다. 이것은 스텔라 네트워크의 내재한 시스템이고, 거래마다 지급해야 하는 수수료도 인플레이션에 기여합니다. 0.00001이라는 아주 작은 거래 수수료는 DoS 공격을 방어하기 위해 존재합니다. \r\n\r\n3. 스텔라 네트워크는 PoW나 PoS가 아닌 스텔라 합의 메커니즘(SCP, stellar consensus protocol)이라는 독자적인 합의 프로토콜을 사용합니다. 이는 자신이 누구를 신뢰할지 직접 선택하고 이로부터 형성된 신뢰망을 통해 합의에 도달하는 방식입니다. \r\n\r\n핵심 가치\r\n(키워드: 공익추구, 실시간 결제)\r\n\r\n1. 공익추구: 비영리 기업인 스텔라개발재단에서 운영하는 스텔라는 금융 인프라가 갖춰지지 않은 개발도상국들의 시스템 개발에 초점을 맞춰 발전하고 있습니다. 실제로 Praekelt Foundation, Oradian과 같은 다른 비영리 단체들이 스텔라를 통해 필리핀, 인도 서아프리카와 같은 지역들에 금융 인프라를 구축하고 있습니다. 이렇게 스텔라는 금융포용(financial inclusion)의 가치를 가지고 서비스를 제공한다는 점에서 차별화됩니다. 한편, 이런 범용적인 서비스 확장을 위해서 리플보다 쉽고 간단한 인터페이스를 추구합니다. \r\n\r\n2. 실시간 결제: 리플과 마찬가지로 실시간 결제(3~5초)가 가능합니다.

Stellar aims to help facilitate cross-asset transfer of value at a fraction of a penny while aiming to be an open financial system that gives people of all income levels access to low-cost financial services. Stellar can handle exchanges between fiat-based currencies and between cryptocurrencies. Stellar.org, the organization that supports Stellar, is centralized like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ripple\">XRP</a> and meant to handle cross platform transactions and micro transactions like XRP. However, unlike Ripple, Stellar.org is non-profit and their platform itself is open source and decentralized. \r\n\r\nStellar was founded by Jed McCaleb in 2014. Jed McCaleb is also the founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, launched the network system Stellar with former lawyer Joyce Kim. Stellar is also a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and drastically reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers. In fact, both payment networks used the same protocol initially.\r\n\r\nDistributed Exchange\r\nThrough the use of its intermediary currency Lumens (XLM), a user can send any currency that they own to anyone else in a different currency.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if Joe wanted to send USD to Mary using her EUR, an offer is submitted to the distributed exchange selling USD for EUR. This submitted offer forms is known as an order book. The network will use the order book to find the best exchange rate for the transaction in-order to minimize the fee paid by a user.\r\n\r\nThis multi-currency transaction is possible because of \"Anchors\". Anchors are trusted entities that hold people’s deposits and can issue credit. In essence, Anchors serves as the bridge between different currencies and the Stellar network.\r\n\r\nLumens (XLM)\r\nLumens are the native asset (digital currency) that exist on the Stellar network that helps to facilitate multi-currency transactions and prevent spams. For multi-currency transactions, XLM is the digital intermediary that allows for such a transaction to occur at a low cost.\r\n\r\nIn-order to prevent DoS attacks (aka spams) that would inevitably occur on the Stellar network, a small fee of 0.00001 XLM is associated with every transaction that occurs on the network. This fee is small enough so it does not significantly affect the cost of transaction, but large enough so it dissuades bad actors from spamming the network. The collected fee is then redistributed and added to an inflation pool. This inflation pool releases Lumens at a rate of 1% each year.",

When it was announced by founder <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-larimer-0a367089/\">Dan Larimer</a> in New York City in May 2017, a giant jumbotron advertisement could be seen glowing over Times Square. In the first 5 days of their <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/eos\">ICO token sale</a>, EOS raised an unprecedented $185 million in ETH — all without having any kind of product or service yet.\r\n\r\nEOS claims to be “the most powerful infrastructure for decentralized applications.” Basically, EOS is (or, rather, will be) a blockchain technology much like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>. They plan to create their own blockchain with a long list of impressive features. Some are even calling EOS the “Ethereum killer.” But along with all the hype and excitement about EOS, there’s also a large amount of skepticism coming from the crypto community.\r\n\r\nThe EOS Vision\r\nEOS has big plans. It will be a software that will act as a decentralized operating system. Developers can then build applications on the EOS software. It will be highly scalable, flexible, and usable. The most notable feature that everyone is getting excited about is horizontal scalability — what this means is the EOS blockchain will be able to allow parallel execution of smart contracts and simultaneous processing of transactions. This could be a real game changer.\r\n\r\nEOS will incorporate the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Delegated+Proof-of-Stake\">delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS)</a> consensus protocol, created by founder Dan Larimer himself. This system is less centralized, uses far less energy, and is incredibly fast — as in, up to millions-of-transactions-per-second fast. Furthermore, there will be no user fees on the EOS blockchain. This would also set them apart from the competition and could help them gain more widespread adoption of their platform.\r\n\r\nEOS also wants to put a blockchain constitution in place to secure user rights and enable dispute resolution.

      "en": "What is Monero?\r\nMonero (XMR) is the top <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=37&view=market\">privacy-centric cryptocurrency</a> based on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Cryptonight\">CryptoNote protocol</a>, a secure, private and untraceable currency system. Monero uses a special kind of cryptography to ensure that all of its transactions are  remain 100% unlinkable and untraceable. In an increasingly transparent world, you can see why something like Monero can become so desirable.\r\n\r\nOrigins of Monero\r\nIn July of 2012, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bytecoin\">Bytecoin</a>, the first real life implementation of CryptoNote, was launched. While Bytecoin had promise, people noticed that 80% of the coins were already published. So, it was decided that the bytecoin blockchain will be forked and the new coins in the new chain will be called Bitmonero, which is was then renamed Monero, meaning “coin” in Esperanto language. In this new blockchain, a block will be mined and added every two minutes.\r\n\r\nWhy Monero?\r\n\r\n#1: Unlinkability - Your identity is completely private\r\n\r\nYou have complete control over your transactions. You are responsible for your money. Because your identity is private no one will be able to see what you are spending your money on. When you send funds to someone’s public address, what happens is that you actually send the funds to a randomly created brand new one-time destination address. \r\n\r\nThis means that the public record does not contain any mention that funds were received to the recipient’s public address. In Monero, your public address will never appear in the public record of transactions. Instead, a 'stealth address' is recorded in a way that only you, the recipient, can recognize the incoming funds.\r\n\r\n#2: Fungibility\r\n\r\nFungibility is interchangeability between one asset and another asset of the same type.\r\n\r\nSuppose you borrowed $50 from your friend, you can even return the money in the form of 1 $50 bill or 5 $10 bill, It is still fine. This shows that the dollar has fungible properties. However, if you were to borrow someone’s car for the weekend and come back and give them some other car in return, then that person will probably punch on the face. Cars, in this example, are a nonfungible asset.\r\n\r\nWhat is <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Cryptonight\">CryptoNote</a>?\r\nCryptoNote is the application layer protocol that fuels various decentralized currencies. While it is similar to the application layer which runs bitcoin in many aspects, there a lot of areas where the two differ from each other. CryptoNote features an entirely new code base and is not a fork of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>. More info about CryptoNote can be found at their <a href=\"https://cryptonote.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>. \r\n\r\nCryptoNote uses Ring Signatures to conceal sender identities via mixing and it also has unlinkable transactions that is achieved using 1-time keys for each individual payments. Ring signatures enable ‘transaction mixing’ to occur. Transaction mixing means that when funds are sent, the sender randomly chooses several other users’ funds to also appear in the transaction as a possible source of the funds being sent. \r\n\r\nThe cryptographical nature of the ring signature means that no one can tell which of the funds were really the source of the transaction – not even the person that gave the funds to the sender in the first place. A system of ‘key images’ associated with each ring signature ensures that although no one can tell the true source of the funds, it can be easily detected if the sender attempts to anonymously send their funds twice. \r\n",

Monero uses a special kind of cryptography to ensure that all of its transactions are  remain 100% unlinkable and untraceable.

In this new blockchain, a block will be mined and added every two minutes.\r\n\r\nWhy Monero?\r\n\r\n#1: Unlinkability - Your identity is completely private\r\n\r\nYou have complete control over your transactions. You are responsible for your money. Because your identity is private no one will be able to see what you are spending your money on. When you send funds to someone’s public address, what happens is that you actually send the funds to a randomly created brand new one-time destination address. \r\n\r\nThis means that the public record does not contain any mention that funds were received to the recipient’s public address.

Instead, a 'stealth address' is recorded in a way that only you, the recipient, can recognize the incoming funds.\r\n\r\n#2: Fungibility\r\n\r\nFungibility is interchangeability between one asset and another asset of the same type.\r\n\r\nSuppose you borrowed $50 from your friend, you can even return the money in the form of 1 $50 bill or 5 $10 bill, It is still fine.

Cryptonote는 링시그니처를 구현하는데, 이는 타인이 거래의 대상자를 파악하지 못하게 하는 시스템입니다. \r\n\r\n코인 특징\r\n1. 모네로는 링시그니처(ring signature)와 일회성 주소(one-time keys, stealth address), 그리고 링CT(ringCT)의 세 가지 방법을 사용해 익명성을 구현합니다. 링시그니처란 거래자의 결제 키를 블록체인에서 접근 가능한 퍼블릭 키들과 섞어 잠재적 사용자들의 키를 링으로 만들어 보여주는 방법으로, 외부자가 거래의 대상자를 특정할 수 없게 합니다. 링을 통해 보이는 사용자들은 모두 거래에 적용 가능한 사람들이므로 외부자는 거래 대상자를 골라낼 수 없습니다. 또한, 거래할 때 송금자만 이용 가능한 일회성 주소가 발급되기 때문에, 코인을 받는 사람도 누가 보낸 건지 추적할 수 없습니다. 이렇게 거래자의 신원을 보호하는 한편, 링CT 기술로 거래액도 보안 될 수 있는 서비스를 제공합니다. \r\n\r\n2. 모네로의 공식적인 공급량은 18,400,000 XMR로 정해져 있지만, 이후 총발행량은 한정되어 있지 않습니다. 총발행량에 도달하고 나면, 그 이후에는 2분(매 블록)마다 일정하게 0.3 XMR이 \"tail emission\"이라는 이름으로 발행될 것이기 때문입니다. 이런 시스템이 있는 이유는 채굴 보상이 끝난 이후, 수수료 이외에도 추가로 블록체인을 유지할 인센티브를 사람들에게 제공하기 위함입니다. \r\n\r\n핵심 가치\r\n(키워드: 익명성, 편리성)\r\n\r\n1. 익명성: 모네로는 링시그니처와 일회성 주소를 통해 기본적으로 거래내용이 비공개로 설정되어 있습니다. 공개 혹은 감사를 받아야 하는 거래기록에 대해서는 view key 기능을 사용해 선택적으로 거래정보를 공개할 수 있습니다. \r\n\r\n2. 편리성: 마이 모네로(MY Monero)를 이용하여 별도의 설치 없이 웹에서 바로 모네로를 실행할 수도 있고, 모네로(Monero)를 설치해서 더 많은 서비스를 받으며 이용할 수도 있습니다.

      "id": "What is Monero?\r\nMonero (XMR) is the top <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=37&view=market\">privacy-centric cryptocurrency</a> based on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Cryptonight\">CryptoNote protocol</a>, a secure, private and untraceable currency system. Monero uses a special kind of cryptography to ensure that all of its transactions are  remain 100% unlinkable and untraceable. In an increasingly transparent world, you can see why something like Monero can become so desirable.\r\n\r\nOrigins of Monero\r\nIn July of 2012, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bytecoin\">Bytecoin</a>, the first real life implementation of CryptoNote, was launched. While Bytecoin had promise, people noticed that 80% of the coins were already published. So, it was decided that the bytecoin blockchain will be forked and the new coins in the new chain will be called Bitmonero, which is was then renamed Monero, meaning “coin” in Esperanto language. In this new blockchain, a block will be mined and added every two minutes.\r\n\r\nWhy Monero?\r\n\r\n#1: Unlinkability - Your identity is completely private\r\n\r\nYou have complete control over your transactions. You are responsible for your money. Because your identity is private no one will be able to see what you are spending your money on. When you send funds to someone’s public address, what happens is that you actually send the funds to a randomly created brand new one-time destination address. \r\n\r\nThis means that the public record does not contain any mention that funds were received to the recipient’s public address. In Monero, your public address will never appear in the public record of transactions. Instead, a 'stealth address' is recorded in a way that only you, the recipient, can recognize the incoming funds.\r\n\r\n#2: Fungibility\r\n\r\nFungibility is interchangeability between one asset and another asset of the same type.\r\n\r\nSuppose you borrowed $50 from your friend, you can even return the money in the form of 1 $50 bill or 5 $10 bill, It is still fine. This shows that the dollar has fungible properties. However, if you were to borrow someone’s car for the weekend and come back and give them some other car in return, then that person will probably punch on the face. Cars, in this example, are a nonfungible asset.\r\n\r\nWhat is <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Cryptonight\">CryptoNote</a>?\r\nCryptoNote is the application layer protocol that fuels various decentralized currencies. While it is similar to the application layer which runs bitcoin in many aspects, there a lot of areas where the two differ from each other. CryptoNote features an entirely new code base and is not a fork of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>. More info about CryptoNote can be found at their <a href=\"https://cryptonote.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>. \r\n\r\nCryptoNote uses Ring Signatures to conceal sender identities via mixing and it also has unlinkable transactions that is achieved using 1-time keys for each individual payments. Ring signatures enable ‘transaction mixing’ to occur. Transaction mixing means that when funds are sent, the sender randomly chooses several other users’ funds to also appear in the transaction as a possible source of the funds being sent. \r\n\r\nThe cryptographical nature of the ring signature means that no one can tell which of the funds were really the source of the transaction – not even the person that gave the funds to the sender in the first place. A system of ‘key images’ associated with each ring signature ensures that although no one can tell the true source of the funds, it can be easily detected if the sender attempts to anonymously send their funds twice. \r\n"

IOTA is a ground breaking new open-source distributed ledger that does not use a blockchain.

The main purpose of IOTA is to solve some of the major problems with Blockchain technology, the main one being that the bigger the Blockchain (such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>), the slower, more expensive, and also more restricting it is to actually transfer funds. Another issue with the Blockchain is size, as more and more Blocks are added, the longer the Blockchain gets, and therefore the less amount of computers are able to mine it.

      "en": "NEM is a highly versatile crypto solution which seeks to adhere to a host of mainstream industry requirements. It is written in Java and JavaScript with 100% original source code. NEM has a stated goal of a wide distribution model and has introduced new features in blockchain technology in its proof-of-importance (POI) algorithm. NEM also features an integrated P2P secure and encrypted messaging system, multisignature accounts and an Eigentrust++ reputation system.\r\n\r\nEssentially, NEM is designed as a financial blockchain solution and can be used for payment, clearing and settlement in a private environment which is highly controlled. This means that NEM meets several of the regulatory requirements and guidelines in the financial industry. This allows it to be used to settle (change of ownership) any asset via the blockchain. Mijin which is a private chain of NEM has gained popularity and companies such as Hitachi have already embraced it.\r\n\r\nWhy NEM?\r\nMany banks around the world have come to accept the importance of blockchain technology. In fact, a good number of banks in the U.S, India and Japan have already started using the technology. Because banks generally employ the smart contract concept, NEM’s platform which is asset-friendly can be used to settle any asset. In settling assets, speed, security, and reliability are very important to a mainstream institution which is what this crypto offers. NEM addresses these issues by repackaging its blockchain into a private chain and presenting it as Mijin.\r\n\r\nNEM crypto is also applicable in the technology world. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin\">Dogecoin</a> which use mining to increase the number of coins, XEM uses something called ‘harvesting’. In this process, blocks are generated and a person is rewarded for work contributed using transaction fees. Every block has a certain number of transactions which attract an unknown amount of fees. This keeps the participants incentivized to continue harvesting. For a blockchain user to be allowed to harvest, one must go through a forging mechanism process called Proof-of-Importance (POI).\r\n\r\nPOI is the algorithm used in NEM to time stamp transactions. A NEM user's importance is determined by how many coins they have and the number of transactions made to and from their wallet. POI uses the NCDawareRank network centrality measure, the topology of the transaction graph, as well as a number of other relevant signals to achieve consensus. POI is different from other initiatives which use a fee-sharing model that does not take into consideration one's overall support of the network. In proof-of-stake systems a person needs to have large numbers of coins to form a block, but in NEM transactions volume and trust become factors. This was designed to encourage users of NEM to not simply hold XEM but instead actively carry out transactions.\r\n\r\nTo be eligible for entering the importance calculation, an account must have at least 10,000 vested XEM. All accounts owning more than 10,000 vested XEM have a non-zero importance score. With a supply of 8,999,999,999 XEM, the theoretical maximum number of accounts with non-zero importance is 899,999. In practice, the number of actual accounts with non-zero importance is not expected to approach the theoretical max due to inequalities in held XEM and also the temporal costs associated with vesting. If NEM becomes very popular, a threshold of 10,000 vested XEM could be undesirable. If necessary, this number could be updated in the future via a hard fork, which is the same procedure for adjusting transaction fees and other parameters related to harvesting.",

PoW는 고가의 채굴 장비가 필요하고, PoS는 사람들이 코인을 보유만 하고 사용하지 않는다면 통화의 유통과 보급에 진행이 없을 수 있다는 문제점이 있습니다. 이를 보완하기 위해 PoI에서는 보유량 이외에도 유통 및 보급에 기여해야 이익을 얻을 수 있는 구조를 만들었습니다. 하베스팅 결과의 조작 방지를 위해 계정에 기록된 코인의 잔액뿐만 아니라 거래의 활동을 방정식에 포함합니다.",

It has custom digital identity standards that enable the creation of electronic identity data for individuals, organizations and even entities. These electronic systems use multi-layered authentication models that include facial and voice recognition as well as fingerprints.\r\n\r\nAll digital assets on the platform enjoy legal protection thanks to the use of digital certificates on its public blockchain.

      "ko": "네오는 중국에서 최초로 만들어진 블록체인 프로젝트로, 스마트 자산 플랫폼(smart assets platform)으로 기능합니다. 이 플랫폼은 네오의 독립적인 스마트 컨트랙트 기술인 '네오컨트랙트'를 기반으로 하며, 이들은 이더리움처럼 네오 버츄얼 머신(VM)위에서 실행됩니다. 이 외에도 DBFT, NeoX, NeoQS와 같은 독자적인 기술을 구현합니다.\r\n\r\n현재 50%의 네오는 크라우드 펀딩을 통해 배포되었고, 나머지 50%는 NEO 위원회에서 관리한다고 합니다. 위원회에서 관리하는 코인들은 구체적인 계획들을 따라 네오 프로젝트를 지원하는 데에 쓰일 것으로 예상됩니다. \r\n\r\n이전에 앤트쉐어(Antshares)로 불렸던 이 코인은 2017년 7월, 네오로 이름을 바꿨습니다. \r\n\r\n코인 특징\r\n1. 네오는 DBFT(delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance)를 컨센서스 메커니즘으로 사용합니다. DBFT는 보다 안전한 블록체인 플랫폼을 구현하기 위해, 노드를 운영하는 북키퍼(bookkeeper)와 블록체인 사용자로 네트워크 참가자를 분리합니다. 전문화된 북키퍼들은 사용자들에 의해 선출되고, 검증마다 이들 중 랜덤으로 블록 생성자가 결정됩니다. 그리고 만약 2/3의 북키퍼들이 검증에 동의하면 컨센서스가 체결됩니다. 이렇게 블록체인 사용 주체를 오롯이 분리해 접근하는 것은 기존 컨센서스 메커니즘에 없던 독특한 방식입니다. \r\n\r\n2. 네오 플랫폼은 네오와 네오가스라는 두 가지의 토큰을 가지고 있습니다. 이더리움과 마찬가지로, 네오가스는 플랫폼에 대한 이용료를 지급하는 데에 쓰이며 지급된 가스는 네트워크를 관리하는 북키퍼들에게 경제적 인센티브로 돌아갑니다.\r\n\r\n3. 양자 컴퓨터는 블록체인 시스템을 무력화시킬 수 있다는 우려가 있습니다. 이에 네오는 NeoQS(QuantumSafe)라는 격자구조의 암호구조를 통해 양자 컴퓨터에 대응할 수 있는 알고리즘을 갖추고 있다고 합니다. \r\n\r\n4. NeoX는 크로스 체인 상호 운영을 지원하는 프로토콜로, 이를 통해 atomic asset swap을 달성할 수 있습니다. 또한, 다른 체인에서 실행되는 스마트 컨트랙트의 일관성을 유지할 수 있습니다. \r\n\r\n핵심 가치\r\n(키워드: 중국시장, 대중적인 컴퓨터 언어 지원)\r\n\r\n1. 중국시장: 14억 인구의 시장인 중국에서 시작된 첫 블록체인 기술이기에 중국 시장에서의 선전을 기대할 수 있습니다. 또한, 중국인들이 서양의 소프트웨어보다 알리바바, 바이두, 텐센트(QQ)와 같은 자신들의 것을 비교적 선호한다는 점에서 잠재력이 큽니다. \r\n\r\n2. 대중적인 컴퓨터 언어 지원: 네오는 C#, Java, Go과 같은 다양한 언어를 지원하고 있고, 앞으로 C, C ++, Python, JavaScript까지 확장할 예정이라고 합니다.

Our improvement over <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> is the addition of privacy. Zcash uses advanced cryptographic techniques, namely zero-knowledge proofs, to guarantee the validity of transactions without revealing additional information about them.\r\n\r\nHow Zcash works\r\n\r\nZcash encrypts the contents of shielded transactions. Since the payment information is encrypted, the protocol uses a novel cryptographic method to verify their validity.\r\n\r\nZcash uses a zero-knowledge proof construction called a zk-SNARK, developed by our team of experienced cryptographers based on recent breakthroughs in cryptography. These constructions allow the network to maintain a secure ledger of balances without disclosing the parties or amounts involved. Instead of publicly demonstrating spend-authority and transaction values, the transaction metadata is encrypted and zk-SNARKs are used to prove that nobody is cheating or stealing.\r\n\r\nZcash also enables users to send public payments which work similarly to Bitcoin. With the support for both shielded and transparent addresses, users can choose to send Zcash privately or publicly. Zcash payments sent from a shielded address to a transparent address reveal the received balance, while payments from a transparent address to a shielded address protect the receiving value. \r\n\r\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/education/what-is-zcash/\">CoinBureau</a> for guide on What is ZCash.",
